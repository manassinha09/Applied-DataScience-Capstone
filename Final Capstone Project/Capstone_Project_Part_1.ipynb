    "## Problem\n",
    "Bangalore is the third most populous city in India, and is home to many technology companies. According to [this article](https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/migrants-constitute-42-of-bengalurus-population/article28734588.ece), more than 42% of Bangalore's population consists of migrants which makes the city's population quite diverse.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Undoubtedly when there is such a large quantity of migrants, there will be a lot of diversity in the food people of the city eat. The idea of this project is to categorically segment the neighborhoods of Bangalore into major clusters and examine their cuisines. A desirable intention is to examine the neighborhood cluster's food habits and taste. Further examination might reveal if food has any relationship with the diversity of a neighborhood.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Stakeholders would be the ones who are interested to use this quantifiable analysis to understand the distribution of different cultures and cuisines over one of the the most diverse cities in India - Bangalore. This project can also be utilized by a new food vendor who is willing to open his or her restaurant. Or by a government authority to examine and study their city's culture diversity better."
